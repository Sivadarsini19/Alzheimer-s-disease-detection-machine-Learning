# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Deep Learning and Streamlit

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from MRI scans. With an accuracy of **97%**, this system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI images into multiple stages of Alzheimer's progression. The results are visualized using an intuitive **Streamlit** web application.
